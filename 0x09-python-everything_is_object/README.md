# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Description
This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why.
